# 8080-Emulator
Simulating a relict of it's time: The 8080 Microprocessor, it used to run iconic games such as Space Invaders or Donkey Kong. It is not yet capable of writing the graphics buffer to the screen but it is just a matter of time to evolve into a full sized emulator with graphics output. 
## Features
The current features of the emulator are:
* Loading and dissassembling hex files + saving to .asm files (Prints Assembly in program view)
* Dynamic RAM view highlighting changes as they appear + customizable display settings + search function for addresses.
* Debugging capabilities
* Register and flag overview
